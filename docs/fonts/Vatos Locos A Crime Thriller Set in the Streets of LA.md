Vatos Locos is part of a trilogy of movies by Damian Chapa, who also directed and starred in El Padrino (2004) and Bad Cop (2009). The trilogy explores the themes of power, corruption, and family in the context of the Latino community in the US. Chapa has said that he wanted to portray the reality of the gang culture and the struggles of the immigrants who live in it.
 
The movie was filmed in various locations in LA, such as Boyle Heights, East LA, and Downtown LA. The movie features a mix of English and Spanish dialogue, as well as some Chinese and Irish accents. The movie also has a soundtrack that includes rap, hip hop, and Latin music. Some of the songs are performed by the actors themselves, such as Damian Chapa and Ricco Chapa.
 
Vatos Locos is not a movie for everyone, as it contains graphic violence, nudity, profanity, and drug use. It is a low-budget production that does not have the polish or the depth of other crime movies. However, it may appeal to some viewers who are looking for a raw and gritty story of survival and loyalty in the harsh streets of LA.

One of the main themes of Vatos Locos is the contrast between the American dream and the harsh reality of the immigrants who pursue it. The movie shows how the characters are trapped in a cycle of poverty, violence, and crime, and how they try to cope with it in different ways. Some of them, like Mickey Solis, embrace their criminal lifestyle and seek to expand their power and wealth. Others, like Esteban and Raul, try to find a way out of the gang life and start a new life. However, they face many obstacles and challenges that prevent them from achieving their goals.
 
Another theme of Vatos Locos is the importance of family and loyalty in the gang culture. The movie shows how the characters form bonds of brotherhood and friendship with each other, and how they are willing to risk their lives for each other. The movie also shows how these bonds are tested by betrayal, jealousy, and greed. The movie explores the moral dilemmas that the characters face when they have to choose between their loyalty to their gang and their personal interests or values.
 
Vatos Locos is a movie that tries to depict the reality of the Latino gang culture in LA, without glamorizing or romanticizing it. It is a movie that shows the dark side of the American dream, and the consequences of living in a society that marginalizes and oppresses a large segment of its population. It is a movie that may not be easy to watch, but may offer some insight into a world that is often misunderstood or ignored by the mainstream media.
