They are defined by the International Voice Association, a cooperative venture by Olympus, Philips, and Grundig. However, DSS files are not widely supported by most audio players and editors, so you may need to convert them to WAV format, which is a standard and uncompressed audio file format that can be played on almost any device.

## Benefits of Converting DSS to WAV
 
There are many benefits to converting a DSS file to WAV. Perhaps the most obvious benefit is that a WAV can be read on any device, whereas a DSS file is limited to devices that support the DSS format. Converting a DSS to WAV also makes the audio easier to edit, as WAV files tend to be more compatible with various audio editors than DSS files.
 
Another benefit of converting a DSS file to WAV is that it can help with security. DSS files are often easier to copy and share than WAV files, which may pose a risk of unauthorized distribution or leakage of sensitive information. By converting to WAV, you can help protect your content from being illegally copied or shared.
 
Converting a DSS file to WAV can also improve the quality of the audio. DSS files are compressed and may lose some details or clarity during the compression process. WAV files are uncompressed and preserve the original quality of the audio. Converting a DSS file to WAV can enhance the sound quality and make it more enjoyable to listen to.
